   device
      `BIG-IP`_ hardware or virtual edition (VE).

   overcloud
      `BIG-IP`_ virtual edition (VE) deployed as an OpenStack instance.

   undercloud
      `BIG-IP`_ device (hardware or VE) deployed outside of OpenStack.

   standalone
      A single `BIG-IP`_ device; no :term:`HA`.

   DSC
      Device Service Clustering provides synchronization and failover of `BIG-IP`_ configuration data among multiple `BIG-IP`_ devices on a network. You can configure a `BIG-IP`_ device on a network to synchronize some or all of its configuration data among several BIG-IP devices; fail over to one of many available devices; and/or mirror connections to a peer device to prevent interruption in service during failover.

   device group
      A device group is a component of a device service cluster. It consists of a collection of `BIG-IP`_ devices that trust each other and can synchronize, and sometimes fail over, their configuration data.

   high availability
   highly available
   HA
      The ability of a `BIG-IP`_ device to process network traffic successfully. An HA device is generally part of a :term:`device cluster`.

   pair
      Two (2) `BIG-IP`_ devices configured to use the :term:`active-standby` :term:`HA` mode.

   scalen
      Two (2) or more `BIG-IP`_ devices configured as an active :term:`device cluster`.

   active-active
      Both `BIG-IP`_ devices in a :term:`pair` are in an active state, processing traffic for different virtual servers or SNATs. If one device :term:`fails over`, the remaining device processes traffic from the failed device in addition to its own traffic.

   active-standby
   active-standby pair
      Only one of the two `BIG-IP`_ devices is in an active state -- that is, processing traffic -- at any given time. If the active device :term:`fails over`, the second device enters active mode and processes traffic that was originally targeted for the primary device.

   failover
   fail over
   fails over
      Failover occurs when one device in an :term:`active-standby` pair becomes unavailable; the secondary device processes traffic that was originally targeted for the primary device.

   mirror
   mirroring
      A `BIG-IP`_ system redundancy feature that ensures sharing of connection and persistence information across a device service cluster; mirroring helps prevent service interruptions if/when :term:`failover` occurs.

   SSL offloading
      `SSL offloading <https://f5.com/glossary/ssl-offloading>`_ relieves a Web server of the processing burden of encrypting and/or decrypting traffic sent via the SSL security protocol.

   one-arm
   one-arm mode
      One-arm mode is a network topology wherein servers/clients connect to the BIG-IP via a single interface; a single VLAN handles all traffic.

   multi-arm
   multiple-arm
   multi-arm mode
   multiple-arm mode
      Multi-arm mode is a network topology wherein servers/clients connect to the BIG-IP via different interfaces; use two or more VLANs to separate management and data traffic.

   vcmp
      Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing (vCMP) is a feature of the BIG-IP system that allows you to run multiple instances of the BIG-IP software on a single hardware platform.

   vCMP host
      The vCMP host is the system-wide hypervisor that makes it possible for you to create and view BIG-IP instances, or vCMP 'guests'.

   vCMP guest
      A vCMP guest is an instance of BIG-IP software created on the vCMP system for the purpose of provisioning one or more BIG-IP modules to process application traffic.

   partition
      A BIG-IP partition is a logical container containing a defined set of BIG-IP system objects. See the `BIG-IP documentation`_ for more information.
