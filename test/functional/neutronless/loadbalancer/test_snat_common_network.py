        - Expect that a SNAT pool is created in the tenant partition with a

        - Expect that the same SNAT pool now has an additional SNAT member for
          the pool member, referenced to member subnet.
        - Delete member and expect that SNAT pool only has member for original
          LB
        - Delete everything else and expect all network objects and tenant
          folder are deleted.
