1) To run the service object rename upgrade tests, you must first deploy a service using
the legacy naming algorithm.  This can be done by executing the container described
by Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.oldname_agent.  To build this container:

$ docker build -t setup_rename_upgrade -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.oldnames_agent ./Dockerfiles

2) You can see a list of available options by running this container with the help option:

$ docker run setup_rename_upgrade --help

usage: run_tests.py [-h] [--action action] [--service-name service_name]
                    [--icontrol-hostname icontrol_hostname]
                    [--member-ip member_ip] [--bigip-selfip bigip_selfip]
                    [--vni vxlan_vni]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --action action		
  --service-name service_name
  --icontrol-hostname icontrol_hostname
  --member-ip member_ip
  --bigip-selfip bigip_selfip
  --vni vxlan_vni

3) The action default is setup, which is what this currently create a full service
object that has loadbalancer, listener, pool, member, and healthmonitor.  This is
full service.  You can change the deployed service by using the --service-name option

--service-name: this is one of the services that are in the lbaas_services.json file:
	"full_service" -- This is the default.
    "listener_noname"
    "pool_noname"	
    "healthmonitor_noname"
    "listener_hm_noname"
    "pool_hm_noname"
    "list_pool_hm_noname"
    "list_pool_noname"

--member-ip: the IP address of the backend pool member.
--icontrol-hostname: The IP address of the BIG-IP device to use for testing
--bigip-selfip: The IP address to use for the BIP-IP device on the test
				network
--vni: This is the VXLAN segmentation Id of the OpenStack network.


4) To run the test you need to create a container with the updated code.

$ docker build -t test_rename_upgrade -f Dockerfile.trusty_liberty .


5) Execute the test

$ docker run --rm test_rename_upgrade --action run_test

6) The test should perform a teardown but if for some reason there is a failure, you can
manually reset:

$ docker run --rm test_rename_upgrade --action teardown


7) The default test service is one where the object names all use OS names, full-service.
The tests services can vary though by using the --service-name.  If the setup uses the
--service-name option, then the test execution needs to use the same option.
