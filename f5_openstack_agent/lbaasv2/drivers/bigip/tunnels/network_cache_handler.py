"""A module that hosts the logic to hold, handle, and update the Network Cache

This module hosts the singleton object-class NetworkCacheHandler.  This
object, as singletone would imply, should only exist in one instance per agent
instance and be held within the AgentManager singleton object.

This library simply hosts this cache handler.
